# ðŸš¨ Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions (MySQL)

This project demonstrates how to detect fraudulent banking transactions using **SQL queries**.  
By analyzing transaction patterns, it identifies suspicious behaviors such as:

- **Frequent High-Value Transactions** â€“ multiple large transfers in a short period  
- **Duplicate Transactions** â€“ repeated transactions with identical details  
- **Unusual Withdrawals** â€“ odd-hour or multi-location activities  

Flagged transactions are stored in a separate table for further investigation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies
- MySQL 8.0  
- SQL (CTEs, subqueries, window functions)  
- CSV Import (`LOAD DATA INFILE`)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Detects high-value fraud attempts  
- Identifies duplicate and unusual transactions  
- Stores suspicious records in `flaggedtransactions` table  
- Optimized queries for efficient fraud detection  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1. Create the database:  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE fraud_detection;
   USE fraud_detection;
Create the bank_transactions table (schema included in repo).

Place your dataset in MySQLâ€™s Uploads folder:

   INTO TABLE bank_transactions
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
   ENCLOSED BY '"'
   LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
   IGNORE 1 ROWS;

5. Run fraud detection queries.

6. View suspicious results in flaggedtransactions.
